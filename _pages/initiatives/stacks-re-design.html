<h3><b>Stacks Re-Design</b></h3>
<p>In 2009, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department announced a decision to reduce the number of fixed computing stations on Grounds. At the time, ITS maintained 400 computers. The number has now been reduced to only 20 computers located in the Brown Science and Engineering Library. The decision was made based on data that showed that nearly every student entered the University with a computer and that advanced software use had decreased.</p>
<p>ITS arranged to hand the space over directly to the University. With the help of the SEAS administration, ESC petitioned the Provost’s Office to instead turn the space over to SEAS for student use. The proposal was accepted and as a result Stacks will remain a student study space.</p>
<p>Given that SEAS had no existing furniture or plans for Stacks, ESC was tasked with providing input as to what engineering students would most like to see in a study space. Through direct consultation with SEAS students and student polling, ESC arrived at a design that incorporated group study space, plenty of available outlets, printing and copying facilities, and comfortable seating. The proposed design includes four group study pods capable of seating six, each with mounted white boards and LCD TV’s.  The design allows for informal use with roughly one sixth of the space being stuffed couches and chairs. Additionally, the design includes plenty of general study space with wheeled seating, study lamps, and outlets. Finally, the proposed design maintains the same printing and copying capabilities that Stacks currently offers.</p>
