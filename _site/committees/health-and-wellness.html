    <p class="lead">Established in 2015, the Health and Wellness Committee (HAWC) is dedicated to ensuring opportunities for engineers of all years to maintain physical and mental health throughout the school year.  As engineers, it is easy to focus solely on schoolwork and forget to take care of our health (both physically and emotionally), and so we strive to provide events that encourage engineers to be aware of and maintain health and wellness. Here are some events the committee has put on in the past year:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sustained Dialogue: Event to promote discussion among engineers on a wide variety of topics that cover the School of Engineering and the University community.</li>
      <li>Yoga Night: In cooperation with the Aquatic and Fitness Center, ESC provided free yoga sessions for interested engineers this Fall.</li>
      <li>Shake off the Stress: During E-Week this Spring, HAWC will be giving away free smoothies during their event that promotes personal relaxation and wellness through de-stressing.</li>
    </ul>
