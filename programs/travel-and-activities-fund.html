<h3><b>Travel & Activities Fund</b></h3>
<p>The Engineering Student Council recognizes that current, involved students are SEAS’s best ambassadors. Students have the potential to further the School’s programs and enhance the reputation of the School by forming organizations for engineers, getting involved in the local community, attending conferences, participating in scientific competitions, and more. In recognition of this, the Engineering Student Council (ESC) has created a Student Travel and Activities Fund (TAF) to help support and finance these efforts.</p>
<p>It is important to note that TAF is a budget maintained by the UVa Engineering Budget Office. This limits ESC’s ability to immediately provide the requested sum to a student/student organization. Therefore, all TAF rewards will be made with a reimbursement. If an applicant is granted an allocation, a reimbursement must be filed for the approved value after the completion of an event or activity. To be eligible for a reimbursement, the applicant is required to turn in all related financial documents, including all proof of expenses.</p>
<p>Applications that outline travel or activities in the recent past may be accepted if the proper documentation is attached (i.e. applying after the trip already happened).</p>
The Engineering Student Council would like to give more opportunities to students by introducing a separate TAF to students and engineering organizations:</p>
<p class="lead">a) If you are student applying for TAF and granted an allocation, please proceed with your event, activity or travel, and turn in the reimbursement as listed in the remainder of this document.</p>
<p class="lead">b) If you are part of a group/organization, this year, groups are required to turn in reimbursements and all necessary documents together. Individuals in the organization are still expected to turn fill out individual reimbursement forms, when applicable. Any reimbursement turned in separately will be returned to the individual. If there are further questions regarding this, please email TAFallocation@gmail.com.</p>

<h4>Proof of Expenses</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>For an event</li>
      <li>For an activity</li>
      <li>For a project funded by TAF</li>
      <li>For travel</li>
    </ol>
    <li>For any travel, local, domestic, or international, it is also required to have one or more of the following:
      <li>Boarding pass (required if an applicant is traveling by airplane, bus, or train)</li>
